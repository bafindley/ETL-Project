# ETL-Project
This repository contains all relevant code and data for our ETL project. 


* This project will contain several datasets relating zip codes in Austin to metrics we found interesting for quality of life.

* This includes: health inspection scores, parks, incident reports, etc. 

* These datasets are not necessarily related in any way other than zip codes. This would be essentially a set-up for a visualization project where we project these metrics across a physical map of Austin and see which correlate to each other.
